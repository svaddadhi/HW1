      			<p>The UC Board of Regents have approved two major projects that are aimed at improving the student experience at UC Santa Cruz by offering more campus housing options and revitalizing aging facilities.</p>
				<p>The Kresge College renewal aims to update the residential college through a mix of new construction and renovation to meet the needs of today's student body.</p>
				<p>Student Housing West will create 3,072 new beds at two sites, one along Heller Drive, the other along Hagar Drive. Additionally, it will provide a new childcare facility that will be able to extend service to the children of faculty and staff, in addition to students.</p>
